# MIA

MIA is a software pipeline for Metabolomics Image Analysis. These images are typically phase constrast miscroscopy (PCM) images, because fluorescent agents may contaminate the cell extracts which will be used for further quantitative analysis.

## Instruction

The example file is "mia_example.m", which performs the analysis over an image of OVCAR-8 under PCM with 10x objective. It calls the main function "mia.m".
