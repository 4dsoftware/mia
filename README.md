# MIA

MIA is a software tool for metabolomics image analysis. These images are typically phase constrast miscroscopy (PCM) images, because fluorescent agents may contaminate the cell extracts which will be used for further quantitative analysis.

## Installation

MIA is developed under MATLAB, and is packaged using MATLAB compiler. Similar to Java application, the software tool requires installation of MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR), which is included in the package. Double-clicking "MyAppInstaller_web.exe" will initialize the installation. After installation of MCR is complete, one can use MIA as an executable. Â 

## Tutorial

As an executable with graphic user interface, MIA is very easy to use. The workflow is illustrated by the following steps. Although buttons need to be clicked, the workflow is automatic as no parameter input is required in addition to image file selection. The software is designed this way so one is aware of what MIA is doing and can make sure everything is done in a satisfactory manner. 

1) Cell Culture popup menu allows one to choose cell culture type, and Worker Option popup menu allows the users to decide whether Step 6 is performed in a single worker or in parallel. 

2) The Current Directory lists all files in current directory. If the current directory is where the images of interest are stored, then Step 1 can be skipped. Otherwise, click "Step 1 Image Folder" to browse the image folder. 

3) Now the current directory is showing all the image files of interest. One can click on each file to preview the image. The highlighted (clicked) image file will be chosen as reference image in this step. Reference image is used to preview the processing result and calculate the filter radius and disk radius for all files in the folder, typically from the same sample. Circle Radius has a default value of 11, and can be adjusted to capture the bright cells. Since bright cells take up a small portion of the total count, the choice of this value does not noticeably affect the total count. For large images, one can crop the image with a margin size defined in Crop Size text box. 

4) (Adherent Cells Only) Step 3 analyzes bright mitotic cells in the image. The analyzed image is shown in the preview window. 

5) (Adherent Cells Only) Step 4 calculates filter radius and disk radius for dark cell detection in the reference image, which will be used for other images in the folder to save computation time. 

6) (Adherent Cells Only) Step 5 analyzes the dark resting cells in reference image. The analyzed image is shown in the preview windows. 

7) Step 6 analyzes all images in the folder. 

More detailed tutorial and examples can be found in Tutorial.pdf. 

## Notes

MIA is designed for on-focus images that were taken in normal light condition. However, some users have reported tjat MIA also applies to blurred or distorted images if one changes the two radii parameters based on experience. This can be done by directly type values into the two text boxes, though it is not recommended.
